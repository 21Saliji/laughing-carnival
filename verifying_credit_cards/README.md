Credit Card Number Validator with Luhn's Algorithm (Python)
This project demonstrates how to implement Luhn's algorithm in Python to validate credit card numbers. Luhn's algorithm is a checksum formula commonly used to detect accidental errors during data entry.

Functionality:

Prompts the user to enter a credit card number (without spaces or hyphens).
Performs Luhn's algorithm to check the validity of the entered number.
Provides feedback to the user indicating whether the number is valid or invalid.

Disclaimer:
This code is for educational purposes only. It should not be used in real-world scenarios for processing sensitive information like credit card numbers. Secure storage and transmission methods are crucial for sensitive data.

Project Covers:

Numerical computations (doubling digits, adding numbers)
String manipulation (extracting digits, formatting output)


Getting Started:

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

Download or clone this repository.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Run the script using python3 luhn_verify_credit_card.py.

Example Usage:

Enter your credit card number (without spaces): 4111-1111-1111-1234
The credit card number is VALID.
Note: This example number is valid according to Luhn's algorithm, but it might not be a real credit card number.
